Ingredients for Paneer manchurian


Soy Sauce Sweet savoury spicy sour and umami flavours and tastes are all

present in the sauce
Ginger Garlic paste These two fresh spices can be a subtle flavour

combination that elevates other ingredients or they can be the dominant

elements that give the dish its spicy but earthy flavour
Spring Onion Spring onions taste milder they rarely taste extremely pungent

and can be eaten raw because of their sweet taste and tender texture
Green Chillies Green chilies are used in this recipe to give it a fiery

kick
The seeds and inner membranes of the pod could be removed to diminish

the blazing hot flavour as well as the heat of the pod
Paneer Manchurian Dry Preparation


Heat oil for deep frying
Mix all the ingredients for batter to a little thick paste
The batter shouldn t be too thick or too thin
Dip paneer in batter and fry till golden
Drain and set aside
Now lets make the sauce
Heat oil in a pan add in onion celery capsicum tomato along with some salt and sugar
Keep cooking till it gets golden brown
Add in the ginger garlic paste and cook for 2 mins or so
chilli powder and mix well

Add in water and bring it to a boil
Add in ketchup soy sauce vinegar and mix well

Now add in little of the leftover batter or cornflour which is mixed with water and mix well so the sauce gets thick
Once it is thickened add the fried paneer and mix well
Add in spring onion and mix well
