what you need for a good biryani,0,2,7,0,0,1,1,0
to make a good biryani always use best quality ingredients the choice of,1,0,13,0,0,3,2,0
good quality basmati rice whole spices spice powders chicken ghee all,1,1,11,0,0,7,1,0
contribute to the flavors of chicken biryani,2,1,7,0,0,4,0,0
1 basmati rice there are so many kinds of basmati rice available in the market for best results choose premium quality basmati rice that is labelled as aged this kind of rice is more firm fluffs up well in chicken biryani without turning mushy aged rice is also more fragrant,2,2,50,1,1,14,9,0
though this biryani is made in a pressure cooker or pot the texture of rice,1,2,15,0,0,5,3,0
grains will come out right without getting mushy if made with aged rice,2,1,13,0,0,3,3,0
2 biryani masala spices good quality whole spices spice powders elevate the flavor of chicken biryani so choose a good quality ready made garam masala powder or biryani masala,2,2,29,1,1,16,3,0
i am also sharing the ingredients for an instant biriyani masala powder if,1,2,13,0,0,5,2,0
you do not have a ready made or store bought masala you can make it in just,1,1,17,0,0,1,5,0
few minutes,2,1,2,0,0,1,0,0
3 chicken we usually use up the cut whole chicken to make the chicken biryani however i always find chicken breast pieces dry out if not marinated well with yogurt if you prefer soft tender succulent pieces of chicken in your biryani then just use chicken thighs drumsticks,2,2,48,1,1,15,7,0
always use bone in chicken as it helps the dish to turn out more flavorful,2,2,15,0,0,3,3,0
4 ghee traditionally chicken biryani was made using ghee since this recipe does not follow the traditional method you can also make it using oil but ghee adds a unique aroma to the dish,0,2,34,1,1,9,9,0

how to make the best chicken biryani,0,2,7,0,0,2,1,0
marination marinating chicken with yogurt spices is the first key step to make the best chicken biryani yogurt tenderizes the chicken the spices enhance the flavors marinating and resting chicken makes it soft succulent so do not skip that if you do not eat curd then can substitute it with coconut milk,1,0,52,0,0,15,12,0
preparing rice basmati rice has to be rinsed very well a few times in ample amount of water to get rid of the starch this prevents the rice grains from turning mushy soaking the rice helps to cook the rice grains to fluffy long so do not skip rinsing soaking the rice well before using,1,1,55,0,0,13,16,0
water this recipe uses plain water to cook the chicken biryani however it can be replaced with coconut milk or chicken stock the quantity of water i have mentioned in the recipe card works well for me with lalquilla old malai basmati rice this ratio works pretty well with any aged basmati rice,1,1,53,0,0,19,9,0
please do adjust the amount of heat in the recipe my recipes are usually low on heat for the indian taste buds since i have young kids at home these levels work well for us,2,1,35,0,0,11,5,0

hi paul,1,2,2,0,0,2,0,0
this recipe has been tested for a single layer of chicken a little more or,1,1,15,0,0,3,3,0
less is fine but if you make in large amounts you should use a wider pot,1,1,16,0,0,3,3,0
this way it cooks perfectly if you use a dutch oven the flame should be low,1,1,16,0,0,3,3,0
i suggest you try a smaller batch 1x since you are a beginner hope this,1,1,15,1,1,4,3,1
