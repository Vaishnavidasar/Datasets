chilli chicken and chicken manchurian are 2 dishes that are made similarly,1,2,12,1,1,5,3,0
but they taste very different i had chicken manchurian in a couple of fine,1,1,14,0,0,3,3,0
dining indochinese restaurants and had absolutely loved it,2,1,8,0,0,1,3,0
in the regular restaurants it is usually made with cubed chicken in a much,1,2,14,0,0,2,2,0
similar way like the chilli chicken just the flavor of soya sauce is much,1,1,14,0,0,6,1,0
more intense in manchurian,2,1,4,0,0,0,0,0
however the ones i had tasted was made with minced chicken balls which were,1,2,14,0,0,4,5,0
crisp fried then tossed in manchurian sauce it just tasted awesome very,1,1,12,0,0,2,3,0
unique,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
after several experiments i got hold on the recipe and loved the way it turned,1,2,15,0,0,3,5,0
out similar to the restaurant chicken manchurian except for the color,2,1,11,0,0,3,0,0
usually manchurian dishes look darker in color due to the liberal use of,1,2,13,0,0,4,1,0
soya sauce since i prefer to minimize it mine turned out pretty bright in,1,1,14,0,0,4,4,0
color,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
if you do not prefer to make the chicken balls you can just make the recipe,1,2,16,0,0,2,5,0

tips to make chicken manchurian,2,2,5,0,0,3,1,0
1 most often i marinate the chicken before frying as it helps to tenderize the chicken you can also skip this step but for best flavor texture setting aside for at least 45 mins is recommended it helps in tenderizing enhancing the flavor,1,2,43,1,3,7,11,0
2 usually chicken stock is used to make the chicken manchurian sauce but i have used water as i did not have it in hand however you can just replace the water use chicken stock,1,1,35,1,1,11,8,0
3 i have deep fried the chicken however you can also grill it and then add it to the manchurian sauce,1,1,21,1,1,3,5,0
4 you can also whip up an entire meal in the same pan just set aside the chicken manchurian and retain some sauce in the pan add cooked noodles or rice and stir fry for a minute you meal is ready in minutes,2,1,43,1,1,12,7,0

hi catherine,1,2,2,0,0,2,0,0
thank you so much,0,1,4,0,0,1,0,0
yes you can make the chicken manchurian with diced chicken,1,0,10,0,0,3,1,0
breasts i wouldn t suggest you make the entire dish and reheat since this is,1,1,15,0,0,3,5,0
a fried appetizer it is good to fry it just before serving and add it to the,1,1,17,0,0,1,4,0
sauce otherwise the chicken will turn soggy you can make the sauce ahead and,1,1,14,0,0,3,2,0
set aside but then it may turn thick as it cools down so you may need to,1,1,17,0,0,0,4,0
sprinkle some water and bring it to consistency first then fry the chicken,1,1,13,0,0,2,4,0
add to the manchurian sauce hope this helps,2,1,8,0,0,4,0,0

hi swasthi,1,2,2,0,0,2,0,0
i have tried this recipe it came out good but this time i m using 12 kg,1,1,17,1,2,4,6,0
chicken i was confused about the measurement of the spices had a quick,1,1,13,0,0,4,3,0
question you have used 250 g of chicken and mine is almost triple quantity so,1,1,15,1,3,5,3,0
do i triple everything,0,1,4,0,0,2,2,0
one of your replies to mscharlotte mentioned about doubling the spices for,1,0,12,0,0,2,3,0
1/2kg instead of 1tbsp your recipe it s 15 tbsp 1/2kg this isn t exactly,1,1,15,1,7,3,2,1
doubling the recipe that s why i was confused about tripling the spices,1,1,13,0,0,3,5,0
sorry if i m confusing you hope you can help,1,1,10,0,0,1,4,0

hi christina,1,2,2,0,0,2,0,0
thanks for trying 12 kg will be almost 5 times of this recipe here are my,1,1,16,1,3,4,3,0
suggestions go with 1 kg 250 grams chicken,1,1,8,1,4,3,2,1
multiply the recipe by 4 times for ginger garlic proportions and corn flour,1,1,13,1,1,6,1,0
rest of the recipe ingredients multiply by 5 it should turn out good,1,1,13,1,1,3,2,0
if the chicken doesn t bind well just add in bit more of corn flour but not,1,1,17,0,0,7,1,0
a lot it makes the balls hard,1,1,7,0,0,2,1,0
you may need to adjust the sauces towards the end taste it and adjust what,1,1,15,0,0,3,3,0
ever is needed,1,1,3,0,0,0,2,0
hope this helps would love to know how it turned out,1,1,11,0,0,1,4,0
