chicken manchurian recipe delicious fried chicken in slightly sweet hot
sour manchurian sauce chicken manchurian is an indo chinese food that
is much popular in the indian subcontinent the vegetarian versions like
gobi manchurian veg manchurian paneer manchurian are also
popular are loved by manychicken manchurian https //wwwindianhealthyrecipescom/wp

chicken manchurian is not an authentic chinese dish but is a fusion food from
the indian chinese cuisine which is developed with the adaptation of chinese
seasoning cooking methods to suit indian taste buds

chilli chicken and chicken manchurian are 2 dishes that are made similarly
but they taste very different i had chicken manchurian in a couple of fine
dining indochinese restaurants and had absolutely loved it

in the regular restaurants it is usually made with cubed chicken in a much
similar way like the chilli chicken just the flavor of soya sauce is much
more intense in manchurian

however the ones i had tasted was made with minced chicken balls which were
crisp fried then tossed in manchurian sauce it just tasted awesome very
unique

after several experiments i got hold on the recipe and loved the way it turned
out similar to the restaurant chicken manchurian except for the color

usually manchurian dishes look darker in color due to the liberal use of
soya sauce since i prefer to minimize it mine turned out pretty bright in
color

if you do not prefer to make the chicken balls you can just make the recipe
with diced or cubed chicken the recipe will remain the same will still
taste awesome delicious

chicken manchurian is best served as a starter or as a side with hakka
noodles or fried rice

preparation for chicken manchurian

1 make sure there is no excess moisture in the chicken before you use it
you can either use cubed chicken or chicken mince keema 

i prefer to chop finely and then use add soya sauce ginger garlic salt 
red chili powder optional and pepper to a mixing bowl mix well for chinese
recipes generally no chili powder is used but i prefer to use to get a a
good color which otherwise is got by food colors in restaurantsmarinate with sauces https //wwwindianhealthyrecipescom/wp

2 add egg white rice flour and corn flour 1 egg white works good for half
a kg chicken i used only half of 1 egg white since i used only 250 grams
chicken do not add more egg otherwise the mixture will turn soggyaddition of egg https //wwwindianhealthyrecipescom/wp

frying chicken

4 heat oil in a pan for deep frying check if the oil is hot enough by
sliding in a small portion of batter it must rise without browning if using
cubed chicken then slide the batter coated pieces to the hot oil fry on a
medium heat until the chicken is golden and crisp when the chicken is cooked
fully bubbles will reduce

if using minced chicken take small portions of the mixture and make balls
fry them in hot oil you may not get round balls that is just fine in case
you want to make perfect round balls then you need to reduce egg or add more
flour but that alters the texture of the ball

egg is used to lock the meat juices and prevents the meat balls from turning
dry a reduction of egg may turn the balls dry and hardfrying balls https //wwwindianhealthyrecipescom/wp

tips to make chicken manchurian

1 most often i marinate the chicken before frying as it helps to tenderize the chicken you can also skip this step but for best flavor texture setting aside for at least 45 mins is recommended it helps in tenderizing enhancing the flavor
2 usually chicken stock is used to make the chicken manchurian sauce but i have used water as i did not have it in hand however you can just replace the water use chicken stock
3 i have deep fried the chicken however you can also grill it and then add it to the manchurian sauce
4 you can also whip up an entire meal in the same pan just set aside the chicken manchurian and retain some sauce in the pan add cooked noodles or rice and stir fry for a minute you meal is ready in minutes

a classic delhi bar dish capsicum ads a nice crunch and freshness hallmark
of chinese cooking vs indian rice/noodles i prefer rumali roti if i can get
it that to me is the indo chinese twist 
your recipe is excellent simple ingredientsi prefer chicken thigh it s a little more forgiving so to the guy who had
problem getting hard chicken he is lucky it is a sign of good quality
chicken industrial chickens are softer but overcooking still results in dry
and hard buttermilk/yogurt classic indian marinating technique check the
chinese velveting techniques baking soda just 20 minutes it transforms
all tougher meat into very soft when stir frying signature chinese makes
cheap cuts tenderloin soft it is useful when preparing large volume

hi 
usually chicken manchurian has more soya sauce than chilli chicken or
sometimes dark soya is used in manchurian ingredients like red chilli or red
chilli sauce are not used in manchurian this is my version of making sauce so
here making manchurian balls is the key difference

corn flour since corn starch is a thickening agent

hi catherine 
thank you so muchyes you can make the chicken manchurian with diced chicken
breasts i wouldn t suggest you make the entire dish and reheat since this is
a fried appetizer it is good to fry it just before serving and add it to the
sauce otherwise the chicken will turn soggy you can make the sauce ahead and
set aside but then it may turn thick as it cools down so you may need to
sprinkle some water and bring it to consistency first then fry the chicken 
add to the manchurian sauce hope this helps

hi swasthi 
i have tried this recipe it came out good but this time i m using 12 kg
chicken i was confused about the measurement of the spices had a quick
question you have used 250 g of chicken and mine is almost triple quantity so
do i triple everythingone of your replies to mscharlotte mentioned about doubling the spices for
1/2kg instead of 1tbsp your recipe it s 15 tbsp 1/2kg this isn t exactly
doubling the recipe that s why i was confused about tripling the spices 
sorry if i m confusing you hope you can help 
thanksreply

hi christina 
thanks for trying 12 kg will be almost 5 times of this recipe here are my
suggestions go with 1 kg 250 grams chicken 
multiply the recipe by 4 times for ginger garlic proportions and corn flour
rest of the recipe ingredients multiply by 5 it should turn out good 
if the chicken doesn t bind well just add in bit more of corn flour but not
a lot it makes the balls hard 
you may need to adjust the sauces towards the end taste it and adjust what
ever is needed 
hope this helps would love to know how it turned out
